# Weather Dashboard
The objective for this project is to create a weather dashboard by utilizing Server-Side APIs - specifically with [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/). Users will be able to search for cities, and will be presented with the city's current weather & its five-day forecast. This application will also save the user's  searched cities to local storage, which then will dynamically create a clickable list so that the user can easily access the weather conditions of their previously viewed cities.

### Built With:
- HTML
- CSS / [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- JavaScript / [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/)
- [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/)
- Weather icons by [Bas Milius](https://github.com/basmilius/weather-icons)

## Usage
Upon initial page load, users will be able to enter a city name into the search bar on the left column. The application would then fetch the current weather information and its five-day forecast for the specific city. This will also dynamically create a search history under the search bar, so that users can refer back to their previously searched cities. The search history can be cleared anytime the user clicks on `Clear History`.
