# Project 6: Server-Side APIs Challenge - Weather Dashboard
The objective for this project is to create a weather dashboard by utilizing Server-Side APIs - specifically with [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/). Users will be able to search for cities, and will be presented with the city's current weather & its five-day forecast. This application will also save searched cities to local storage, which then will dynamically create a clickable list so that the user can re-visit the weather conditions of previously viewed cities.

## Built With:
- HTML
- CSS
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- JavaScript / [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/)
- [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/)
- Weather icons by [Bas Milius](https://github.com/basmilius/weather-icons)
